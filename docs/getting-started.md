## Setup

### Prerequisites

These are the required tools (and coding languages) to get the project up and running.
1. Install [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
1. Install [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)
1. Install [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) and Install [CRC](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers) (**Recommended**)
1. Install [docker-for-mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install)

_Note:_ You can use minikube, but we'll need to install additional resources.

### Setup steps

1. Start your local kubernetes cluster. 

   For crc:
   ```sh
   # It's advised to create a new crc install with more cpu and more memory. 
   # This gives crc 8 cpu and 12288 MB of ram. (Suggested to use 12288 MB for Prometheus).
   # Small crc clusters are hard to work with and if your computer can handle it, run with these settings

   crc start -c 8 -m 12288
   
   # At this point you will be asked to input your secret.
   # Secret available on: https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned
   <paste_secret>

   # After setup is complete, ensure commands are available using eval().
   eval $(crc oc-env)

   # Login to your local kubernetes cluster.
   # This information is available on terminal
   # after the 'crc start' command was completed.
    oc login -u kubeadmin -p <your_login_info> <your_cluster_info>
    
    # Optional: to enable Monitoring/Prometheus, refer to your version of CRC: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.12/html/getting_started_guide/administrative-tasks_gsg#starting-monitoring-alerting-telemetry_gsg
   ```

   For minikube:
   ```sh
   # Minikube is lightweight compared to crc but we still require a cerain amount of cpu's and ram.
   # Small clusters are hard to work with and if your computer can handle it, run with these settings

    minikube config set cpus 2
    minikube config set memory 4000

    # Start minikube
    minikube start

    # Minikube requires a few additional resources. 
    # This command will install: operator-framework, prometheus operator, and kube-state
    make setup-minikube

    # Ensure commands are available using eval().
    eval $(minikube docker-env)
   ```

1. Create a docker Setup with a private registry on Openshift CRC or use quay.io. Creating a [quay.io](https://quay.io) account is the easiest
   registry to start development.

1. Add your registry url to a local .env file. And source it. Some tools will do
   the sourcing automatically for you.

   ```sh
   export IMAGE_REGISTRY=your.registry.url.here/username
   ```

1. Build and push your images for the operator.

    ```sh
    operator-sdk build your.registry.url.here/username/image-name
    docker push your.registry.url.here/username/image-name
    ```

1. Start developing! Re-push and iterate.

## Building and Running

### Building and pushing

```sh
# Builds the executable and packages the docker image
 make build

 # Pushes the image to your registry.
 make push
```

### Running locally (manually)

```sh
# Once the image is made and available you can run these commands

# make uninstall ensures there is no prior installation on your system
make uninstall

# make install will install all the crds and the operator image with an example CR.
make install

## Note: you can chain together make commands --so you can run this one command instead:
make build uninstall install

```

---

## Local Development

### Developing with Skaffold (automatic)

For a faster dev experience you may enjoy skaffold.

Development flows can be improved a bit using [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/). To use these steps you'll need to install skaffold.
The skaffold script is made to redeploy resources as needed.

When you install skaffold, you can then run these commands:

```sh
# Run skaffold in dev mode, will watch file changes and auto restart pods
make skaffold-dev

# Run skaffold in run mode, will not watch changes
make skaffold-run
```

### Developing with operator-sdk (automatic)

This is a very fast method of rebuilding locally. It uses the same roles as the real operator by supplying a kubeconfig to the operator-sdk run command.

This is recommended if you do not want to pull and push images to remote registries.

```sh
make setup-operator-sdk run-operator-sdk
```

---

## Testing

Testing has been simplified thanks to the Makefile.

```sh
# Run unit tests
make test

# Results in amount of code coverage provided via unit tests
make test-cover

# Run end to end - uses your current kubectl context
# end to end will run the controller and test to make sure it installed correctly
make test-e2e

```

Unit tests are available in the same folder of the file being tested.
I.E. MarketplaceConfig unit tests are available under `/pkg/controller/marketplaceconfig`. 

_Note:_ the testing suite is undergoing updates,
as such, this may undergo changes.
